This module provides a `#[main]` macro, intended for use on your entry-point
`main` function.

It has the following effects:

- enables [`::color-eyre`] for nicely-formatted colored error backtraces.
  - we default to `RUST_LIB_BACKTRACE=1` in `debug` builds
- enables console output for log messages from `tracing` and `log`.
  - we default to log level `WARN` for imported crates
  - we default to log level `INFO` for the current crate
- wraps main in a `Result` with an `eyre::Report` to enable use of `?` to
  propogate top-level errors into a crash.
- `main()` can optionally be defined with primitive integer return type (or an
  `ez::Int`). if so, the process will use `main()`'s return value as its exit
  status, as in C. (This ensures that all destructors on the stack have had a
  chance to run, which is not the case when calling `std::process::exit()`
  directly.)
- `main()` can optionally be defined to take one or two arguments, which will be
  the values and count (respectively) of the arguments the process was invoked
  with, like `argv` and `argc` in C.
  - `argv` must be a `Vec<String>`. If any of the arguments are not valid UTF-8,
    a warning will be logged and invalid segments will be replaced with the
    replacement character `'ï¿½'`.
  - `argc` must be a `usize` or an `ez::Int`
  - `envp` must be a `Map<String, String>`. If any keys or values are not valid
    UTF-8, an error will be logged and they will be excluded from the list. This
    is a frozen copy and does not reflect any changes later.
