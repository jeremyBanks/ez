## `erro`

providing attribute macros `#[throws]` and `#[try_throws]` that succinctly cover most of the ecosystem's common error handling patterns, building on top of `thiserror` and `eyre`.

- `doop`, providing a macro for local code duplication with loop-style syntax.
- `implicint`, providing an integer type that implicitly converts to the required type where possible.
- `ez`, providing a `#[ez::main]` attribute for the `main` function that adds a few conveniences.
- `batteries`, a "batteries-included" collection of widely-used Rust libraries, as a potential starting point for new users
